2. **Diagramação**: Diagramamos artigos, relatórios, Trabalhos de Conclusão de Curso, dissertações, teses, livretos, cartilhas, revista e livros. Seguindo as Normas da ABNT (quando se aplicar) e personalizações dos usuários; 

3. **Ciência de dados**: Todo tipo de problema que envolva dados públicos e que estão na internet, para extração dos dados, limpeza dos dados, análise exploratória dos dados, investigações e aplicação de estatística descritiva. Dados do DATASUS e Portal de dados abertos do governo são umas das fontes de dados que consultamos. Aquira dados e análise para embasar: trabalhos acadêmicos, release de reportagens joranlísticas, dentre outros. 

## Projetos gratuitos e livres 

### Aprenda Cálculo 

Este projeto surgiu como um inquietamento frente a esse momento de incertezas e recolhimento domiciliar para evitarmos a propagação do Coronavírus (COVID-19). Irá reunir um material já produzido de videoaulas de exercícios resolvidos de pré-cálculo e cálculo. A proposta é oferecer um conteúdo gratuito e livre dos principais tópicos de pré-cálculo e cálculo para todo(a)s o(a)s universitário(a)s. 

O projeto está hospedado neste App Web, em [Aprenda Cálculo](https://www.2dados.com/aprendacalculo). Foi incialmente pensado para oferecer duas vezes na semana, videoaulas ao vivo (Live no Canal Disponha Cálculo no Youtube). No entanto, inicialmente terá videaulas gravadas antecipadamente e liberadas nas datas específicas segundo o cronograma. 

**É gratuito e livre.**

**Público-alvo**: Todos que queiram aprender.

### Curso de LaTeX 

O [Cuso de LaTeX](https://www.2dados.com/cursolatex) é uma contribuição para a comunidade, que pretende mostrar como trabalhar com escrita cienttífica utilizando LaTeX para preparação de documentos, seja estes relatórios, artigos, tcc, dissertações, teses, dentre outros. 

**É gratuito e livre**.

**Público-alvo**: Todos que queiram apnder.

### Canal no Youtube Disponha Cálculo 

O [Disponha Cálculo](https://www.youtube.com/user/DisponhaCalculo/) é um canal no Youtube, que reúne mais de **100 videoaulas** de exercícios resolvidos passo a passo de pré-cálculo e cálculo(limite, derivada, integral, aplicações da integral, sequências, séries, EDO, Integral dupla e outros).

## Experienced Research and Applied Core Team

!!! abstract "Ritchie Ng"
    Currently I am leading artificial intelligence with my colleagues in [ensemblecap.ai](https://ensemblecap.ai/), an AI hedge fund based in Singapore comprising [quants and traders from JPMorgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/ex-jpmorgan-traders-start-singapore-currency-options-quant-fund). I have built the whole AI tech stack in a production environment with rigorous time-sensitive and fail-safe software testing powering multi-million dollar trades daily. Additionally, I co-run, as portfolio manager, our deep learning systematic portfolio, delivering positive annual returns since 2018.
    
    I am also an [NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute instructor](https://www.facebook.com/nus.nvidia/) leading all deep learning workshops in NUS, Singapore and conducting workshops across Southeast Asia.
    
    In my free time, I'm into deep learning research with [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) and NUS where I am a research scholar in [NExT (NUS)](http://www.nextcenter.org/). 

    My passion for enabling anyone to leverage on deep learning has led to the creation of [Deep Learning Wizard](https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/) where I have taught and still continue to teach more than 2000 students in over 60 countries around the world. The course is recognized by [Soumith Chintala](https://pytorch.org/2018/01/19/a-year-in.html), Facebook AI Research, and [Alfredo Canziani](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6407592585275142144), Post-Doctoral Associate under Yann Lecun, as the first comprehensive PyTorch Video Tutorial. 
    
    I have taught [Deep Learning Foundations](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse) with Alfredo Canziani at Rwanda, Africa for the African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) in 2018 supported by Google and Facebook.
        
    I was previously conducting research in meta-learning for hyperparameter optimization for deep learning algorithms in NExT Search Centre that is jointly setup between National University of Singapore (NUS), Tsinghua University and University of Southampton led by co-directors [Prof Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) (KITHCT Chair Professor at the School of Computing), [Prof Sun Maosong](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224193416561782037/20101224193416561782037_.html) (Dean of Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University), and [Prof Dame Wendy Hall](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/wh) (Director of the Web Science Institute, University of Southampton).
    
    I graduated from NUS where I was an NUS Global Merit Scholar, Chua Thian Poh Community Leadership Programme Fellow, Philip Yeo Innovation Fellow, and NUS Enterprise I&E Praticum Award recipient. I was awarded the [IT Youth Leader of the Year Award](https://www.scs.org.sg/it-leader-awards/winners-by-year.php?year=2019) in 2019.

!!! abstract "Jie Fu"
    I am undergoing my postdoc journey at Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) to prepare for the coming AI winter, as Eddard Stark said "He won't be a boy forever and winter is coming" -- Game of Thrones. I am privileged to work with Christopher Pal.

    I earned my PhD degree from National University of Singapore (NUS), and was fortunately under the supervision of Tat-Seng Chua and Huan Xu, also closely working with Jiashi Feng and Kian Hsiang Low.
    
    I am interested in machine learning. More specifically, my research is focused on deep learning, probabilistic reasoning, reinforcement learning and neural abstract machines. I am especially excited about reducing the gap between theoretical and practical algorithms in a principled and efficient manner.

##  Supporters

!!! abstract "Alfredo Canziani"
    Alfredo is the main person who inspired Ritchie to open-source Deep Learning Wizard's materials. We are very grateful for his advice particular in the space of open-source projects, deep learning and PyTorch.
    
    He is currently working as a Post-Doctoral Deep Learning Research Scientist and Lecturer at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, under the supervision of professors KyungHyun Cho and Yann LeCun.
    
    Do check out his latest [mini-course on PyTorch](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse) that was held in Princeton University and was delivered with Ritchie Ng at AMMI (AIMS) Kigali, Rwanda supported by Google and Facebook.
    
!!! abstract "Marek Bardonski"
    Since graduation, Marek has been working on state-of-the-art research. He was involved in inventing the system that diagnoses problems with Ubuntu packages using Machine Learning and in improving the detection accuracy of breast cancer using Deep Learning, each time leading 40 highly skilled Machine Learning/Deep Learning engineers for over 6 months.

    NASA noticed his unique skills and asked him to manage a project aiming to improve the International Space Station rotation algorithm that would allow them to collect enough power from solar panels while preventing them from overheating. The project was successful and generated a huge ROI for NASA. Marek has been honored by multiple Harvard professors and the Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA, who signed an official Letter of Recommendation.

    Since his first summer of university coursework, Marek has participated in four internships at NVIDIA HQ and Microsoft HQ. He also spent one year in NVIDIA Switzerland optimizing Deep Learning inference for self-driving cars and, by implementing very efficient Deep Learning algorithms in the GPU assembly language, improving the speed of Tesla’s cars self-driving engine inference. He's currently the Head of AI at [Sigmoidal](https://sigmoidal.io/).
