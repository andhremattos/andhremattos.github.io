# CPU to GPU Production-level Pipeline for AI
At Deep Learning Wizard, we cover the basics of some parts of the whole tech stack for production-level CPU/GPU-powered AI.

The following pipeline is created by [Ritchie Ng](https://www.ritchieng.com/) and it's currently being deployed at production-level at firms around the world including [ensemblecap.ai](https://ensemblecap.ai/) where it powers multi-million dollar trades daily. This AI pipeline is entirely based on open-source distributions.

This stack would get you started, and enable you to adjust the stack according to your needs.
